    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Our portfolio optimization strategy involves the use and implementation of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and analysis of the Efficient Frontier graphs. The objective of the portfolio optimization strategy is to maximize the portfolio return while maintaining the minimum portfolio risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Portfolio Theory states that since it is assumed that all investors are risk-adverse, when considering the possible portfolio allocation strategies, the investor will prefer the portfolio that maximizes the possible return while maintaining a given amount of risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Efficient Frontier (EF), the core of our strategy, was introduced by Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz and is fundamental to MPT. The EF is a graph that illustrates all possible portfolios portfolio allocation distributions. The x-axis represents the volatility/risk of the portfolio, while the y-axis represents the expected return of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Efficient Frontier shows the optimized portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk and the lowest level of risk for a given level of expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the an Efficient Frontier graph is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![EF Graph](ef.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen from the graph, the light blue dot is the portfolio that takes on the highest level of risk coupled with the highest degree of return. Conversely, the left-most purple dot depicts the portfolio that with the lowest level of risk and lowest given level of return. Typically, risk-seeking investors will select portfolios that lie on the right end as they yield a higher return for a high level of risk. In our group's case, we chose the \"safe\" strategy, and thus will be selecting the portfolio on the left-end of the graph as it yields a lower return for a lower level of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We will be discussing more about how we graphed each portfolio along the EF graph below. Additionally, we will also provide a comprehensive conclusion of our strategy and analysis at the very end."
